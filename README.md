# MUDgametest
Try to make a MUD(Multi-User Dungeon) game use Java. Unfinished. 一个未完成的泥巴游戏尝试。

'''

Please run the Client after run the Server.  
You need only one Server and any of a number of Clients.  
The Server can work anywhere(your own computer or ECS or...), but remember to change the ip in client.  

'''

The name of this game is "Survive or Perish". SP ^^
中文译作：存亡之争

I try to use words instead of images to describe the game. (Because I cannot draw so many pictrues for this game.. .as a busy college student)

我想要在这种文字游戏中实现实时的打斗，但是又无法完成那么多的打斗素材，所以想要用文字代替图像和声音。不过这似乎不现实……

目前初步完成了如下图的场景，仅仅是针对打斗场面的一个Demo。

其实这张图是为了上交作业应付审核者emmm

### Client

Get the operation from players, then send to the Server to get response.

### Server

Receive the information from all the client, do some calculate, then send something back.


I will be glad if you want to help me finish this game-test. (or just use it...^ ^)
Just clone!
